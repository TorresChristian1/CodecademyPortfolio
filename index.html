        <p id="mspara">I want to be able to bring happiness and accomplishment for my clients and showase the incredible work that I build and give all sizes
            of businesses to feel they can go to one developer and have a site built with competition on their mind and give small businesses and large 
            corporations to have the same chance of getting clientele. I believe in giving quality products for excellent results while providing easy access
            for client and services to ensure their site is taken care of and they can focus on other business needs.

            <p id="aboutpara">I am a Father of 2 boys and proud to be there for them while also building websites from the front and back and spending time
                with my sons and writing codes and my oldest seeing it interesting just like me. I believe in family time and working alongside each other, but
                still spending time with our children and cherishing those moments. I do believe showing our children the possibilities in the world and how 
                higher education or learning from bootcamps or other means they can be able to see all the type of careers and the impact they can make for
                the next generation.
